# news_project
Udacity news log project
- I have not included the database (.sql) because it exceeded the limit of 100 mb on git hub.

- After running the vagrant, go to news_project and run articles.py file.

- All the queries are written in articlesdb.py file

- The webpage will be running on the url http://localhost:8000

- I assumed in the first part that the status of the arrticles does not matter as a matter of fact it does but the question does not say that.
